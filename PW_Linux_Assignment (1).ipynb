        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Linux is an operating system that works similarly to Unix. It is based on the Linux Kernel. The kernel is the main part of the Linux operating system that controls how the computer interacts with the hardware and uses its resources. It makes sure everything runs properly.\n",

        "### Q2) What is the difference between Hard Link & Soft Link?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** In Linux, both hard links and soft links are ways to create references to files,\n",
        "but they work very differently at the system level.\n",
        "\n",
        "A hard link is essentially another name for the same file. It points directly to the\n",
        "same inode, which means both the original file and the hard link share the same data\n",
        "on disk. When you create a hard link, no new data is created — just an additional\n",
        "filename that refers to the same content. If the original file is deleted, the data\n",
        "is still accessible through the hard link because the content exists until all hard\n",
        "links pointing to it are removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Soft link (also known as a symbolic link) is like a shortcut. It does not point to\n",
        "the data directly but instead stores the path to the original file. This soft link\n",
        "has its own inode and is treated as a separate file by the system. When you access\n",
        "a soft link, the system follows the path stored inside it to reach the original file.\n",
        "If the original file is deleted, the soft link breaks and becomes a non-usable link,\n",
        "since its target no longer exists. Soft links can point to files across different\n",
        "filesystems and can also link to directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of storage, hard links do not take extra space for the file content because\n",
        "they use the same inode. Soft links do use a small amount of space, just enough to\n",
        "store the path to the original file.\n",

        "**Ans:** kernel is the core part of the Linux OS. It manages CPU and memory usage,\n",

        "as a bridge between user space (applications) and hardware.\n",

        "### Q5) What is the ‘grep’ command used for in Linux?\n",

        "example-:\n",
